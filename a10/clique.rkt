;; A Node is a Sym
;; A Graph is one of:
;; * empty
;; * (cons (list v (list w_1 ... w_n)) g)
;; where g is a Graph
;; v, w_1, ... w_n are Nodes
;; v is the in-neighbour to w_1 ... w_n in the Graph
;; v does not appear as an in-neighbour in g

;; (is-clique? lon g) produces true if list of nodes form a clique in the graph
;; Examples:
